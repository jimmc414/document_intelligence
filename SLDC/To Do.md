Create a top-level directory with a descriptive name for your project, such as document_intelligence. This will contain all the files and folders related to your project.

Move your main.py file to this directory and rename it to something more specific, such as document_classifier.py. This will be the entry point to your application.

Create a subdirectory called app inside the top-level directory. This will contain all the modules and packages that implement the core logic of your project.

Move your model.py and utils.py files to the app directory. These are modules that define classes and functions for your project.

Create a subdirectory called data inside the app directory. This will contain all the data files that your project needs, such as images, labels, embeddings, etc.

Move your data folder and its contents to the data directory. You can also organize your data files into subdirectories based on their type or purpose, such as train, test, validation, etc.

Create a subdirectory called tests outside the app directory. This will contain all the tests for your project, such as unit tests, integration tests, etc.

Move your test.py file to the tests directory and rename it to something more specific, such as test_model.py. This is a module that contains tests for your model module.

Create a subdirectory called docs outside the app directory. This will contain all the documentation for your project, such as README, LICENSE, API docs, etc.

Move your README.md file to the docs directory and update it with relevant information about your project, such as description, installation, usage, etc.

Create a file called LICENSE in the docs directory and add the appropriate license text for your project. You can use choosealicense.com3 to help you select a license.

Create a file called setup.py in the top-level directory. This will contain the package and distribution management information for your project, such as name, version, dependencies, etc. You can use setuptools4 to help you create this file.

Create a file called requirements.txt in the top-level directory. This will contain the list of external packages that your project depends on, such as numpy, tensorflow, opencv-python, etc. You can use pip to help you generate this file.

Your final project structure should look something like this:

document_intelligence/ ┣ app/ ┃ ┣ data/ ┃ ┃ ┣ train/ ┃ ┃ ┣ test/ ┃ ┃ ┗ ... ┃ ┣ model.py ┃ ┗ utils.py ┣ tests/ ┃ ┗ test_model.py ┣ docs/ ┃ ┣ README.md ┃ ┗ LICENSE ┣ setup.py ┣ requirements.txt ┗ document_classifier.py
