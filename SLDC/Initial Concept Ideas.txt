The idea is for a business to be able to scan a list of a variety of documents and have a process that automatically processes them, classifies them, indexes them to records in another system by using named entity recognition technology.

Outline of the futuristic document processing system:

1. Document Scanning
   a. Collect documents from various sources
   b. Use advanced scanning hardware for optimal digitization
   c. Convert scanned images into machine-readable format using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

2. Data Preprocessing
   a. Clean and filter errors from recognized text
   b. Normalize and standardize the text for better analysis
   c. Extract key information using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques

3. Document Classification
   a. Train a machine learning model to recognize document types (e.g. invoices, contracts, reports)
   b. Apply the trained model to automatically assign categories and subcategories to documents
   c. Store the classified documents in a structured database

4. Entity Recognition and Indexing
   a. Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) technology to identify key entities
   b. Link recognized entities to records in another system
   c. Train the system to better recognize new entities

5. Integration with other systems
   a. Sync the indexed records with existing databases and systems, such as CRM or ERP
   b. Enable automated actions based on identified entities and their relationships (e.g. contract renewal, invoice payment)
   c. Implement APIs for integration with third-party systems

6. User Interface and Analytics
   a. Develop a user-friendly interface for managing and searching the indexed documents
   b. Implement advanced search and filtering options
   c. Generate actionable insights and reports based on the processed data

Specific technologies to use:

1. Scanning: TWAIN-based scanning software or dedicated hardware (such as Fujitsu ScanSnap)
2. OCR: Tesseract OCR, ABBYY FineReader or Adobe Acrobat Pro
3. NLP and NER: Spacy, Google Cloud Natural Language API, or OpenAI GPT-3
4. Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch or Scikit-Learn
5. Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
6. API Framework: RESTful API or GraphQL
7. User Interface: Angular, React or Vue.js
8. Analytics: Tableau, Google Data Studio or Microsoft Power BI

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

a. Clean and filter errors from recognized text
- Use Python and the 're' library for regular expressions to find and remove common scanning and OCR errors.
- Remove special characters, extra spaces, and incorrect line breaks.

b. Normalize and standardize the text for better analysis
- Convert the text to lowercase using Python's str.lower().
- Remove stop words (common words like "a", "an", "the") using Python's NLTK library or spaCy.
- Perform stemming (reducing words to their root form) or lemmatization (obtaining the base form of words) using NLTK or spaCy library.

c. Extract key information using NLP techniques
- Use Python's spaCy or the Google Cloud Natural Language API to extract sentences, tokens, or parts of speech.
- Identify relevant terms or phrases by calculating Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) using Scikit-Learn.

Step 3: Document Classification

a. Train a machine learning model to recognize document types
- Create a labeled dataset of different document types and their content.
- Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Use supervised machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Deep Learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTM) from TensorFlow or PyTorch for classification.

b. Apply the trained model to automatically assign categories and subcategories to documents
- Use Python's Pickle or joblib to save and load the trained model.
- Preprocess and standardize new documents as done in step 2.
- Utilize the previously saved model to predict the document class.

c. Store the classified documents in a structured database
- Use a software like PostgreSQL or MongoDB to set up a database to store document information, including the document type, file name, and processing date.
- Store the preprocessed and classified document content in the database.

Step 4: Entity Recognition and Indexing

a. Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) technology to identify key entities
- Utilize spaCy, Google Cloud Natural Language API, or OpenAI GPT-3 to perform NER in the preprocessed text of classified documents.
- Extract entities such as dates, names, addresses, organizations, or custom entities specific to the organization.

b. Link recognized entities to records in another system
- Connect with the target system (e.g., CRM or ERP) using their API (SOAP or REST) or a database connection.
- Map the detected entities (e.g., customer names or product codes) from the documents to the corresponding fields in the target system.
- Create or update records in the target system based on extracted entities.

c. Train the system to better recognize new entities
- Collect feedback from users and improve the labeled datasets by adding new entities and relationships.
- Retrain the NER and classification models using the new labeled dataset.
- Deploy updated models to maintain and improve the accuracy of entity recognition and document categorization.
