Data Collection and Preprocessing Guide

This guide provides a detailed outline for collecting and preprocessing data from documents, extracting key information, and categorizing the extracted data in a 3rd party system. The process involves several steps, including text extraction, optical character recognition (OCR), named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, summarization, and clustering.

1. Data Collection

Create a directory structure to organize the input and output documents, following the example structure below:

- autoindex
    - documents (store PDF files here)
    - txt_output
    - ner
    - sentiments
    - summarization
    - pegasus_summarization

Place the PDF files to be processed in the "documents" folder.

2. Text Extraction

Run `autoextractpdf2text.py`, which converts searchable PDF files into plain text format. It extracts the text from PDF files and saves it as `.txt` files in the "txt_output" folder.

3. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

For non-searchable PDFs, perform OCR by running `autoocr_parallel.py`. It converts non-searchable PDF files into plain text files and saves them in the "txt_output" folder.

4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Run `autoner.py` to extract proper names, case numbers, account numbers, and legal terms from the text files. The results will be saved in the "ner" folder.

5. Sentiment Analysis

Perform sentiment analysis on the text files using `autosentiment.py`. The sentiment analysis results, including polarity and subjectivity scores, will be saved in the "sentiments" folder.

6. Text Summarization

Generate summaries of the extracted texts using `autosummarize.py`. These summaries will be saved in the "summarization" folder. Additionally, run `pegasus_summarize.py` for more in-depth Pegasus summarization, which will be saved in the "pegasus_summarization" folder.

7. Clustering and Categorizing

Cluster and categorize the processed documents based on the similarity of content using `similarity_clustering.py`. This script will group similar documents together and identify the most frequent phrases in each category. You can then classify these documents in the 3rd party system according to their categories.

8. Main Process Execution

Finally, you can initiate the entire process by running `main.py`. This script will execute each step listed above sequentially and call each corresponding script to provide a complete and automated data collection and preprocessing pipeline.

By following this guide, you should be able to successfully collect, preprocess, and categorize data from a multitude of documents, extract key information from them, and manage it all in a 3rd party system effectively.
