**Detailed Requirements Specification Document: AutoIndex**

1. Introduction
AutoIndex is a system that automatically categorizes documents after receiving scanned documents and performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The system's main function involves categorizing these documents and locating the corresponding account in a 3rd party system. The project consists of several Python scripts to execute various tasks such as OCR processing, Named Entity Recognition, similarity clustering, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.

2. Modules & Functionalities

2.1. autoextractpdf2text.py
- Extract text from searchable PDF files
- Skip non-searchable PDF files
- Save the extracted text into *.txt files

2.2. autoocr_parallel.py
- Perform OCR on non-searchable PDF files in the documents folder
- Save the OCR results into *_ocr.txt files

2.3. autoner.py
- Extract proper names, case numbers, account numbers, and legal terms from the text files using token patterns and Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Save extracted information into *_ner.txt files

2.4. autosentiment.py
- Perform sentiment analysis on text files and calculate polarity and subjectivity scores
- Save sentiment analysis results in *_sentiment.txt files

2.5. autosummarize.py
- Generate summaries of text files
- Save summaries into *_summary.txt files

2.6. autoindex/pegasus_summarize.py
- Generate deeper summarization of text files using PEGASUS model
- Save summaries in pegasus_summarization folder

2.7. automatic_similarity_clustering.py
- Perform clustering on text files based on similarity among documents
- Utilize KMeans algorithm and cosine similarity
- Determine the optimal number of clusters

2.8. autoidentification.py
- Extract specific details (e.g., case number, plaintiff name, address) from the text
- Use methods such as pattern matching and NLP techniques to extract the required information

2.9. feature_extraction.py
- Pre-train a word2vec model
- Vectorize text by averaging word vectors
- Skip the document if no vector is found

2.10. main.py
- Run the individual Python scripts in sequence: autoextractpdf2text.py, autoocr_parallel.py, autoner.py, autosentiment.py, autosummarize.py, and pegasus_summarize.py (in order)
- Display categorized text files based on similarity
- Display the most frequent phrase (specific phrases) and information extracted

3. Required libraries and packages
- Python 3.x
- PyMuPDF
- pdf2image
- pytesseract
- nltk
- spacy
- gensim
- TextBlob
- sumy
- scikit-learn
- transformers (Hugging Face)

4. Directory Structure

```
- autoindex
- documents (Store PDF files here)
- txt_output
- ner
- sentiments
- summarization
- pegasus_summarization
```

5. Output
Upon running `main.py`, the script will generate output in the respective directories:
- Extracted text from PDF files in the `txt_output` folder
- Named Entity Recognition results in the `ner` folder
- Sentiment analysis results in the `sentiments` folder
- Text summarization results in the `summarization` folder
- PEGASUS summarization results in the `pegasus_summarization` folder
6. System Requirements & Setup

6.1. System Requirements
- A computer with Python 3.x installed
- Sufficient hard disk space to store PDF files, intermediate files, and output files

6.2. Setup
- Install required packages and language models using pip and Spacy download command, as described in section 3 (Required libraries and packages)
- Create necessary directories as mentioned in section 4 (Directory Structure)
- Store the scanned documents as PDF files in the "documents" directory
- Run the `main.py` script to initiate the AutoIndex workflow that will automatically execute Python scripts related to OCR processing, Named Entity Recognition, similarity clustering, sentiment analysis, and text summarization

7. Performance Considerations & Enhancements

7.1. Performance Considerations
- Processing large PDF files, especially during OCR, can be resource-intensive and time-consuming
- The accuracy of NER and information extraction may vary based on the quality of scanned documents, text formatting and the presence of similar text patterns
- The depth and quality of summarization may vary based on the complexity of text content and algorithms employed

7.2. Enhancements
The system can be improved by incorporating following enhancements:
- Parallel processing and multithread support to improve processing speeds
- Fine-tuning NER models and utilizing advanced NLP models to improve accuracy in Named Entity Recognition and information extraction
- Implementing better clustering algorithms, optimizing cluster determination, and applying more advanced similarity measures to enhance document categorization
- Adding more summarization models to achieve comprehensive, higher-quality summaries
- Incorporating a user-friendly web interface for uploading files and displaying results
