document_classification.py
This program classifies documents into a particular category. It uses a TfidfVectorizer to convert the document to a vector, and then trains a LogisticRegression model to classify the document.

Requirements
Python 3
requests
os
sklearn
Usage
To use the program, you need to have some documents in the C:\python\autoindex\txt_output directory. The program will iterate through all the files in this directory and classify them into one of the following categories:

some_category
another_category
yet_another_category
The program will write the classification of each document to a file with the same name in the C:\python\autoindex\document_classification directory.

To run the program, simply execute the following command:

python document_classification.py

Example
For example, suppose you have a document called document.txt in the C:\python\autoindex\txt_output directory that contains the following text:

This is a sample document for testing purposes.

The program will classify this document as some_category and write it to a file called document.txt in the C:\python\autoindex\document_classification directory.

How it works
The document_classification.py program works by first converting the document to a vector using a TfidfVectorizer. A TfidfVectorizer is a statistical method that calculates the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) of each word in the document. The term frequency is the number of times the word appears in the document, and the inverse document frequency is the logarithm of the ratio of the total number of documents in the corpus to the number of documents that contain the word. The tf-idf value reflects how important a word is in a document relative to the corpus.

Once the document is converted to a vector, the program trains a LogisticRegression model to classify the document. A LogisticRegression model is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to classify documents into two or more categories. It uses a logistic function to estimate the probability of each category given the document vector, and then assigns the document to the category with the highest probability.

The LogisticRegression model is trained using some sample documents and their known categories. Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new documents.
