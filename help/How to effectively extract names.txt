The best method to extract first names and last names from miscellaneous text documents for autoindexing and document intelligence workflow in law firms would be to employ a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) models, specifically Named Entity Recognition (NER).

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text documents by removing special characters, extra whitespace, HTML tags, and URLs. Additionally, convert the text into lowercase or a standard format to maintain consistency.

2. Tokenization: Tokenize the text into individual words or tokens, making it easier to analyze and identify names.

3. Named Entity Recognition: Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify entities such as names, organizations, and locations in the text. You can use pre-existing NLP libraries and models like spaCy, NLTK, or Stanford NER, or you may also train an ML model using deep learning techniques such as RNN or LSTM for a domain-specific NER model.

4. Rule-based extraction: Utilize a rule-based approach in conjunction with NER to filter potential names, such as ensuring that detected names start with an uppercase letter and are followed by a lowercase letter sequence. You can also implement a list of common first and last names to improve accuracy.

5. Post-processing: Once the names are identified, group them by frequency or proximity to improve the extraction and output of relevant names in the document. Assign first and last names based on context within the text, such as using proximity to keywords like "Mr.", "Ms.", or "Mrs.".

6. Evaluation: Test the extraction process using a collection of labeled documents for validation to ensure the accuracy and quality of the results. Use evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the performance of the extraction model.

Ensure continuous improvement of the extraction model by applying updates based on feedback, enhancing the NER model, and refining the rule-based approach.
