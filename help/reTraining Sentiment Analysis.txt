To train the sentiment analysis model on its mistakes and ground truth, you can use TextBlob's custom classifier solution. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Create a labeled training dataset with ground truth.

Prepare a file named `training_data.csv` containing text and the corresponding sentiment labels (positive, neutral, or negative). The file should have a format similar to this:

```
text,label
"I love this product!",positive
"It's a horrible experience",negative
"Nothing special, but it's okay, I guess",neutral
...
```

2. Train the custom sentiment classifier.

Use the training dataset to train a custom sentiment classifier using TextBlob's `NaiveBayesClassifier`. You can train the classifier with the following code:

```python
from textblob.classifiers import NaiveBayesClassifier
import csv

def load_training_data(training_data_file):
    with open(training_data_file, 'r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        next(reader)  # Skip header
        return [tuple(row) for row in reader]

training_data = load_training_data('training_data.csv')
custom_classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier(training_data)
```

3. Update the `sentiment_analysis` function to use the custom classifier.

Modify the `sentiment_analysis` function to use the custom sentiment classifier you have just trained. Replace the existing blob sentiment calculation with the sentiment classification based on your trained model:

```python
def sentiment_analysis(input_path, output_path, classifier):
    with open(input_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as input_file:
        text = input_file.read()

    prediction = classifier.classify(text)

    with open(output_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as output_file:
        output_file.write(f"Sentiment: {prediction}\n")
```

4. Update the main section of the script to call the new `sentiment_analysis` function.

Update the main section of the script to call the modified `sentiment_analysis` function and include the custom classifier as an argument:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
    training_data = load_training_data('training_data.csv')
    custom_classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier(training_data)
    ...
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(input_directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.lower().endswith(".txt"):
                ...
                sentiment_analysis(input_file_path, output_file_path, custom_classifier)
                ...
```

By following this step-by-step guide, you can train a custom sentiment classifier with TextBlob and use it to perform sentiment analysis while taking into account the mistakes and ground truth information in your training dataset.
