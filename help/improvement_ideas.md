### Sentiment analysis:
Use a pre-trained language model to improve accuracy.
Allow users to filter documents by sentiment.
## **Emotion detection**: 
This type of sentiment analysis labels data with one or more emotions based on the emotional state or feeling expressed in the text. For example, “I am so happy today” would be labeled with happiness, “I am so angry today” would be labeled with anger, and “I am so sad today” would be labeled with sadness.
## **SpaCy**: 
A popular Python library for NLP that offers various tools and algorithms for sentiment analysis. You can use spaCy to train and evaluate models based on features extracted from text, such as word embeddings. You can also use spaCy to perform rule-based matching, dependency parsing and coreference resolution. SpaCy is easy to use and extremely fast when running in production. SpaCy offers a pre-trained model that supports sentiment analysis out of the box, as well as a tutorial on how to create your own custom sentiment classifier. 
## **Flair**: 
A Python library for NLP that uses state-of-the-art deep learning models for sentiment analysis. You can use Flair to train and evaluate models based on contextual string embeddings, such as BERT or ELMo. You can also use Flair to perform text classification and language detection. Flair is easy to use and has a comprehensive documentation and examples. Flair offers several pre-trained models that support sentiment analysis out of the box, such as TextClassifier or SequenceTagger. 
## **Sentiment.ai**: 
A Python package for using deep learning models for sentiment analysis. You can use Sentiment.ai to train and evaluate models based on features extracted from text, such as word embeddings or character-level embeddings. You can also use Sentiment.ai to perform text classification and sentiment polarity detection. Sentiment.ai is easy to use and has a simple API. Sentiment.ai offers a pre-trained model that supports sentiment analysis out of the box, as well as a benchmark against other popular packages. For different types of sentiment analysis, you could consider some of these options: 
## **Polarity detection**: 
This type of sentiment analysis labels data into positive, negative or neutral based on the overall tone or attitude of the text. For example, "I love this product" would be labeled as positive, "I hate this product" would be labeled as negative, and "I don't care about this product" would be labeled as neutral. 
## **Aspect-based sentiment analysis**: 
This type of sentiment analysis identifies and extracts specific aspects or features of a product or service from the text, and labels them with their corresponding sentiments. For example, "The camera is amazing but the battery life is terrible" would identify "camera" and "battery life" as aspects, and label them with positive and negative sentiments respectively. 
## **Emotion detection**: 
This type of sentiment analysis labels data with one or more emotions based on the emotional state or feeling expressed in the text. For example, "I am so happy today" would be labeled with happiness, "I am so angry today" would be labeled with anger, and "I am so sad today" would be labeled with sadness.
