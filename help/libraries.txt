1. PyMuPDF: PyMuPDF is a Python library that offers seamless access and manipulation of PDF files. In this project, it's used in the `autoextractpdf2text.py` script for extracting text from searchable PDF files.

2. pdf2image: pdf2image is a Python library that converts PDF files to images, enabling easier processing and analysis of non-textual content. In the `autoextractpdf2text.py` script, this library is used to convert non-searchable PDF files to images for OCR processing.

3. pytesseract: pytesseract is a Python wrapper for the Tesseract OCR engine, enabling optical character recognition capabilities for converting scanned images and non-searchable PDFs to text. It's used in the `autoocr_parallel.py` script to extract text from non-searchable PDFs.

4. nltk: Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) is a Python library for working with human language data, providing tools for text processing, tokenization, parsing, and classification. In this project, nltk is utilized in the `text_preprocessing.py` script for tokenizing text, converting to lowercase, and removing stopwords.

5. spaCy: spaCy is a fast and modern Python library for natural language processing (NLP). It's used in the `autoner.py` script for extracting proper names (persons) from the text files, and in the `info_extraction.py` for extracting case numbers, plaintiffs, and addresses.

6. Gensim: Gensim is a Python library specializing in topic modeling and document similarity analysis, offering various algorithms including Word2Vec, FastText, and LSA. In the `feature_extraction.py` script, it's utilized to vectorize the preprocessed text for clustering.

7. TextBlob: TextBlob is a simple Python library for processing textual data that offers basic NLP features, including sentiment analysis and translation. In the `autosentiment.py` script, it's used to perform sentiment analysis on the text files.

8. sumy: A Python library that provides functionality to summarize texts using algorithms like LSA, LexRank, and Luhn. In the `autosummarize.py` script, sumy is used to compute text summarization for the processed text files.

9. scikit-learn: A popular Python library for machine learning and data science, offering tools for data preprocessing, training algorithms, and model evaluation. In the `similarity_clustering.py` script, scikit-learn is used for k-means clustering and the TF-IDF vectorization of extracted texts.

10. transformers (Hugging Face): A Python library for state-of-the-art natural language processing, based on transformer model architectures like BERT and GPT. Although it is mentioned in the README, there is no evidence in the code that it is actually used in any script.

11. OpenAI API - Whisper: This API service is provided by OpenAI and offers an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system called Whisper, capable of transcribing spoken language audio data into written text with high accuracy. It's applied in the `audioextracttext.py` script to transcribe the audio files to text.
